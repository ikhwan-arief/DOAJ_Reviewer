law.  These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.

These terms do not imply any licenses other than those
expressly granted in these terms.

## Patent Defense

contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and
take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32
days of receiving notice.

Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.
